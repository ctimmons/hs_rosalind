hs_rosalind
===========

Haskell implementations of the exercises found at the [Rosalind Project](http://rosalind.info).

I'm learning Haskell as I write these apps.  My goal is to write all of the code myself, so none of these projects depend on 3rd party libraries.

Unless otherwise stated, all of the programs:

- Compile with a simple call to "ghc -i.. main"
- Run by redirecting a data file into main.exe, e.g. "main < rosalind.data".  Any results are sent to stdout.
