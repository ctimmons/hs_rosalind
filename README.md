hs_rosalind
===========

Haskell implementations of the exercises found at the [Rosalind Project](http://rosalind.info).

Unless otherwise stated, all of the programs:

- Compile with a simple call to "ghc main"
- Run by redirecting a data file into main.exe, e.g. "main < rosalind.data".  Any results are send to stdout.
